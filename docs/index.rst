**MOEA/D** (*Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition*) 
is a general-purpose algorithm framework. It decomposes a multi-objective 
optimization problem into a number of single-objective optimization sub-problems 
and then uses a search heuristic to 
optimize these sub-problems simultaneously and cooperatively. **MOEA/D** is a state-of-art framework 
in aggregation-based approaches for multi-objective optimization. 

The goal of this python package is to provide a modular framework for researchers who are working 
on variants of **MOEA/D**.
