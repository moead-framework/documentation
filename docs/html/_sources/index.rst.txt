**MOEA/D** (*Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition*) 
is a general-purpose algorithm framework. It decomposes a multi-objective 
optimization problem into a number of single-objective optimization sub-problems 
(or simple multi-objective optimization problems) and then uses a search heuristic to 
optimize these sub-problems simultaneously and cooperatively.
